API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface. An API does the work of retrieving data in a variety of forms from its original home to a source that is requesting that data. The source may be you making a request through the web or it may be a mobile app retrieving map data from Google. A search for What is an API will result in many great tutorials. I found a quick 3-minute video that covers this topic well and will prepare you for the remainder of the lecture. Note, this video is put out by a company but I do not mean it as an endorsement for the company, I just like their concise description. Let’s take a look…

So why should a data curator be interested in APIs? You’ve probably guessed by now that the answer is APIs deliver data!

APIs provide the messenger service you need to collect data from sites like Twitter, MySportsFeeds, RottenTomatoes, Twitch, Bloomberg and more… Most of these sites will require you to apply for an API key and may have restrictions on the use of their data. For example, RottenTomatoes, states “Please note that at this time we no longer support unauthorized use of our data (e.g. unofficial projects, non-user facing data integrations).”

If you are interested in working with data, whether it be as a Data Curator, a Government Docs Librarian, or a Data Scientist, it will benefit you to be familiar with APIs.
